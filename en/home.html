      <p class="section--content section--content--en">
        Our story begins with a passionate Alexandrian student with an analytical personality.
        Upon entering university, he discovered that his favorite juice chain, Mecca Juice, has a branch right next to his campus.
        He decided to embark on a daring adventure: to explore the menu and try something different almost every time.
        During this time, he started rating each item on the menu, sharing his thoughts with his friends, recommending the good options, and warning them about the bad ones.
        These ratings remained verbal for more than a year until he decided to document them in writing to immortalize them and share them via WhatsApp.
        Now, after the mastermind behind this idea has traveled beyond the borders of the country, his journey with the reviews has come to an end.
        It is time for the reviews to reach the public and live on, so that the idea does not die.

            Another juice from the sobia mixes section in Mecca Juices. As a fan of strawberry milkshakes, I had
            high hopes for this mix, and actually, this mix would be great for anyone who loves strawberry because
            strawberry overshadows the taste over the sobia. I would have preffered the sobia's concentration in the mix was stronger,
            but it's not a problem. Maybe the negative part was that the coconut taste from the sobia did not completely complement
            the strawberry. Also, it needed more time in the blender because the strawberry was still chunky especially the final sips.
            In conclusion, the mix is a good one when compared to its price and I recommend it especially for strawberry lovers.

            I have returned once again with a new order in the sobia mixes section from Mecca juices which is the Sobia Dates mix.
            I enterred this experience with high hopes because I am a fan of the date milkshakes, and I absolutely adore
            the date milkshake from Dina Farms. Starting of with the positive part which is that the juice tastes great, although
            I see that if the sobia had a stronger taste it would have been even better. My problem with this juice is that
            it was dense and heavy, and that it sometimes needed chewing before I swallowed it. Also, their use of
            Balah black dates instead of dried dates contributed in it being dense.<br>
            In the end, it is not the worst juice in the world, but it could've been better.

            From the Mecca Mixes menu today I tried one of the most famous mixes in general and I can say that
            they they were able to bring out the best of that Mix. The ration of carrots to oranges is amazing and nothing is too much
            from both. The sweetlike taste of the carrots is a great addition to the mix without making it too sweet. It is also well-blended so 
            the texture of the juice is light and easy to drink.<br> A great experience to be honest and I highly recommend it especially
            that it is tasty and healthy!

            Today I tried a mix of two of my favourite drinks, which are kiwi and lemon. I liked the juice a lot in the beginning
            because of the refreshing sensation from the lemons and the taste of kiwi. However, the lemons taste overshadowed the taste of kiwi
            and I would have preffered that it was a less. I expected an acidic zing and I did get it since both fruits are acidic so it was a bit burning.
            Generally, it is not the worst thing but I still do not recommend it.

            Today, after a while of not trying anything new, I decided to give this mix a shot.
To begin with, the strawberry flavor was natural and distinct, and the yoghurt complemented it perfectly.
Overall, the taste was quite similar to strawberry milkshake, which was expected, but it was even better.
The texture of the juice was good and not overly thick.
In general, the experience was great, and it’s one of the best things I’ve tried. <br>I highly recommend this juice!

          <p class="p--reviews">Today, I went back to a juice I had tried before but didn’t review at the time.
            The banana date mix combines two things I absolutely love which are banana milkshake and date milkshake, so I was really excited to try it.
            The juice was tasty not bad. However, my issue with it was that the banana flavor overwhelmingly overshadowed the date flavor.
            The taste of the dates was barely noticeable, just a faint hint, so it felt like I was drinking regular banana milk with just a subtle trace of dates that didn’t really stand out.
            Overall, as a taste, I’d give it 8/10 because I love banana milk a lot, but honestly, I could just get regular banana milk for a cheaper price.
            The texture of the juice was really good, though, and it was easy to drink.

          <p class="p--reviews">Today, I decided to try something different, even though I was a bit hesitant about this mix.
            However, it truly surprised me and exceeded all my expectations! The combination of banana and pomegranate worked amazingly well together.
            The slight tanginess and sweetness of the pomegranate paired perfectly with the mellow flavor of the banana, as if they complete each other.
            It’s a truly unique taste experience that you don’t come across every day. The texture of the juice was excellent,
            striking a balance between the relatively thick consistency of banana and the lighter texture of pomegranate juice.
            It achieved a perfect middle ground—not too thick and not watery. I highly recommend it, and those who try it won’t regret it!

            The juice is a mix of two classics. To start with, the texture of the juice was thick,
            which was expected since both components on their own aren’t exactly light.
        The taste was good not bad, but pretty average. It didn’t have anything particularly unique or standout about it.
        I could recommend it, but honestly, I think you could get something tastier for the same price.

            Today's review is for my all-time favorite juice at Mecca Juice, right next to the classics (like sobia, kharob, etc..).
            It’s a fantastic blend of blueberry flavor and the perfect refreshing chill of ice, especially in hot weather,
            I don’t think I’ll find anything better than this.
            The texture of the juice is excellent, leaning towards a watery consistency.

            Today, I’m going to talk about the twin of the blueberry smoothie, which is equally my favorite at Mecca Juice.
            The addition of yogurt gives the juice another direction and flavor.
            The juice combines the taste of blueberry with the depth and creamy touch that yogurt adds.
            Of course, the ice in the smoothie provides a refredhing effect, especially in the summer.
            The texture of the juice is perfect.The comparison between this and the blueberry smoothie really comes down
            to a preference for the flavor and the addition of yogurt, or simply a matter of mood and the desire for a change.
            In the end, they’re quite similar. I highly recommend it!

          Name: Cream Ashtoota<br />
          Final Score: 8<br />
          Details: The most famous dessert of 2023 faced its toughest test today, which is me trying and reviewing it, and it surprised me
          and exceeded my expectations. Let’s start with reviewing of the cake itself. It was light yet sweet and soft,
          soaked in milk, which made it melt in the mouth. The layer of cream on top is the star of the dish,
          setting it apart from any regular cake. Despite being cream, which is usually dense, it was incredibly light.
          The flavor was sweet but in a balanced way, not masking other flavors with sugar. The distinct taste of the cream still came through.
          As for the rice pudding that came with it, it was fairly standard,
          nothing particularly special, but it was good and a nice complement to the Ashtoota.
        There are additional toppings you can add, like lotus(Biscoff), mango, or ice cream.
        I think lotus or ice cream would pair especially well with it, and I plan to try those options next time after experiencing it in its original form.
